Configuring Pages

Create Lightning Page - always

Remember to always create and activate the Lightning Page by clicking “Edit Page” on a random record.
After saving the Lightning Page activate it as “Org Default” for Desktop and Phone.

 

Lightning Page naming convention

Name the Lightning Page “Object Name Record Page”.

 

Minimize the number of Lightning Pages per Object

To keep the implementation maintainable for the admin and understandable for the end-user, keep the number of Lightning Pages per Object low. Mostly 1 per object is sufficient.

Instead use Component Visibility to hide certain components on the Page.

 

Always use Dynamic Forms whenever possible

When available, Dynamic Forms should be used. For existing customers where Dynamic Forms are not yet activated, activate Dynamic Forms on an object when needed.

Dynamic Forms are not yet available on all objects, for example: 

Campaigns, Products, Tasks, Events, Notes, QuoteLineItems, OpportunityLineItems, WorkOrder, WorkOrderLineItem and ServiceAppointment.

 

Maintain one Lightning Page when using Record Types

When using Record Types in combination with Dynamic Forms: use visibility rules on sections to make distinction between the fields to show per Record Type. This way it is possible that the same field is put on the Lightning Page multiple times, but only will be shown once. As such there is no need for multiple  Lightning Pages.

 

Always enable “Dynamic Forms on Mobile” (offline unsupported)

Always enable “Dynamic Forms on Mobile”, except when offline view and/or edit of records is needed in the Salesforce mobile app. When this feature is enabled, offline features will not be available on the Mobile app.

 

Maintain fields only on Dynamic forms (except for offline or special use cases)

In case there is no offline functionality needed for the Salesforce Mobile App and a Page Layout is not needed for the Field Service Mobile App or for an Experience site, it is sufficient to maintain the fields on the Dynamic Forms of the Lightning Page.

 

Add all fields to the Page Layout

It is still important to add the fields to the Page Layouts for some functionalities: 

Inline editable fields of list views

Opportunity clone with related

Therefore all fields should be added to the default Page Section of the Page Layout.  

 

When to maintain Fields on both Dynamic Forms and Page Layouts

 

Offline functionality for the Salesforce Mobile App

When offline view and/or edit of records is needed in the Salesforce mobile app, both Dynamic Forms and Page Layouts need to be maintained. Dynamic Forms for the Desktop version and Page Layouts for the mobile app. Don’t forget to add the “Record Detail – Mobile" component to the Lightning Page and don’t enable “Dynamic Forms on Mobile”. 

 

Page Layouts for the Field Service Mobile App

When using the Field Service Mobile App: Page Layouts will be used for the fields and related lists on the mobile app. Maintain the necessary Page Layouts which will be used in the mobile app (ex. Asset, Account, Contact) 

 

Page Layouts for Salesforce Experiences

For Salesforce Experiences: maintain a separate Page Layout for the Experience. Dynamic Forms are not available in Experience Cloud (on the Salesforce roadmap). 

 

Minimize the number of Page Layouts per Object

To keep the implementation maintainable for the admin and understandable for the end-user, keep the number of Page Layouts per Object low. Mostly 1 per Object is sufficient, except when sharing the Object with Experiences.

Instead use Field-Level Security or Object Security to hide or show Fields and Related Lists on the Layout for certain Users.

 

Page Layout naming convention

When just a single Page Layout for an Object is sufficient, the name should simply be: ‘Object-name Layout’. For example: ‘Opportunity Layout’.
In this case the default name is typically fine.

When multiple Page Layouts for an Object are required, the name should include the Record Type or ‘Experience’.

Some examples:

Customer Layout

Supplier Layout

Account Partner Experience Layout

 

Always activate Dynamic Actions

Always use Dynamic Actions for new Lighting Pages and new Orgs. 

Also, always enable “Dynamic Actions on Mobile” in the settings of “Salesforce Mobile App”.

 

Page Layout Actions - only add Activity and Chatter

Actions for Activity and Chatter still need to be added to the Page Layout, the Lightning Page Activity and Chatter components rely on them.

Other actions on the Page Layout should be removed, except in cases where the Actions are not controlled by the lightning page (Lightning Experience Page Layouts, Field Service Mobile App).

 

Add Dynamic Actions for Mobile App only: Activities and Chatter - Always

Post, File, Email – these are mobile only actions

New Task, New Event, Log a call – add Form Factor filter for Phone. 

The standard lightning components for these activities do not work on mobile, therefore these buttons are needed.

 

Do not activate "Enable page-level dynamic actions for the Salesforce mobile app" 

Only activate this setting on the lightning page when there is a good reason to do so. By default this should not be activated.

 

Set “Visible Action Buttons (desktop only)” to 7 (instead of the standard 3)

This enhances the users experience by avoiding an additional click in most cases.

 

Edit Lighting Pages - for uniformity

There are lots of possibilities with Lightning Pages. That’s great, but there should always be some uniformity in place.

A good default Lightning Page could be:

At the top, in the following order: Highlights-panel, Related List Quick Links and Path-panel (when applicable)

At the left (large), in the following order: Details-tab, Chatter-tab, Report-tab (when applicable), and other custom tabs

At the right (small), in the following order: Related-tab (including “Potential Duplicates” when applicable) and Activity-tab (when applicable)

This is just a default example. The Page can of course be adjusted however the customer likes. For example the “Related”-component could be put left instead of right, so it’s displayed larger for important data.

 

Set Default Tab to “First Tab”

In the Tabs-component make sure to always set the Default Tab to “First Tab”.

 

“Hide path update button” - Always

Often when the “status” of the record is changed, validation rules will require other fields to be adjusted on the record as well. This will render the update button on the path useless and causes confusion for the end-user. Therefore always hide the update button.  

 

Edit Dynamic Actions/Buttons - for uniformity

Remove Clone-button

When it doesn’t make much sense to often Clone a record for the Object-type, remove that default button.

 

Remove obsolete default Actions

A lot of default Actions are added to the Page Layout by Default. Remove the ones which won’t be used, such as “Submit for Approval”, “Change Owner”, “Change Record Type”, ..

 

Order standard and custom buttons/actions

Make sure to have the standard and custom buttons/actions in a uniform order on every Page Layout for every Object.

Some examples:

Put the regular actions in the following order: Edit then Delete, followed by Clone (if applicable) and any custom buttons/actions

Put the Chatter-actions in the following order: Post then Poll.

Put the Activity-actions in the following order (if applicable): New Task, New Event, Log a Call, Email

It’s also important to remove any unnecessary actions. For example unused Chatter-actions such as “File”, “Link” and “Question” must be removed. Also remove any other default Global Actions such as “New Lead”, “New Account”, ..

 

Edit Page Layouts/Dynamic Forms - for uniformity

Remove standard “Auto Number” field

When the “Name”-field has been chosen as an Auto Number. Just remove that Field from the Page Layout/Dynamic Form, since it’s also visible via the highlights-panel.

Otherwise it clutters the layout.

 

Add sensible Sections to organize the Fields

Take time to figure out a sensible order for the Fields. This has a direct impact on the user adoption.
Use Sections to organize the Fields, but don’t exaggerate with an overload of Sections.

 

Add Master-Detail and Lookup Fields in the top-right corner of the first section

When Master-Detail and Lookup Fields are always in the top-right corner of the first section it helps the users navigate the application.

The standard Owner-field can also be added there.

 

Add other important Fields in the top-left corner of the first section

Similarly, other important fields besides the “Name”-field should be in the top-left corner.

 

Leave Created By and Last Modified By in the “System Information” Section

Finally, always keep “Created By” and “Last Modified By” in the default “System Information” Section.
Leave that Section at the bottom, also (just above “Custom Links”).

 

Change Tab-key Order to “Left-Right” - Page Layout only

The default-created “Information”-section has a Tab-key Order of “Top-to-Down”.
For most people “Left-to-Right” makes more sense.
The same applies for the Sections “System Information” and “Custom Links”.

For custom Sections it's “Left-to-Right” by default.

 

Enable “Display Section Header On” for both Detail Page and Edit Page - Page Layout only

The default-created “Information”-section has its Section Header hidden.
Always make it Visible. It makes the layout look more organized.
The same applies for the Sections “System Information” and “Custom Links”.

For custom Sections it’s enabled by default.

 

Related Lists should always be maintained on the Page Layout

Dynamic Related Lists are not supported on the mobile app. Also, not all Related Lists are available as Dynamic Related List yet (ex. Files, History). Therefore the Related Lists on the Page Layouts are still the default way to maintain related lists. 

“Related List – Single” also rely on the Related Lists of the Page Layout.

 

Dynamic Related Lists

Only use Dynamic Related Lists for specific use cases (filtering). In that case, don’t forget to foresee a (sub optimal) alternative for the mobile app by use of “Related List – Single".

For conditionally showing a related list, still use “Related List – Single” instead of Dynamic Related Lists, because the Dynamic Related Lists are not available on the Mobile App.


Tip: Related Lists – Quick Links displayed lists can be customized by users themselves
