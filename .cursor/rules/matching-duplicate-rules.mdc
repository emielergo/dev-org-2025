Creation of Matching Rules and Duplicate Rules

The Name of the Matching Rule should always start with the Object-Name, followed by the Field-Name(s).
E.g. “Supplier Relationship Unique Key” or “Contact Name and Email or Mobile or Address”.

Remember when selecting a Lookup or Master-Detail Field in the Matching Rule, not the ID but the Name of the parent-record is matched. To prevent confusion and mistakes, refrain from using Lookup or Master-Detail Fields in Matching Rules. Instead, create a Custom Field (e.g. “Unique Key”) of Field-type “Text” in which the ID of the parent-record is copied via an Apex Trigger. Additionally, it is not possible to use more than one relationship field in a single Matching Rule. Using the same approach, multiple fields can be combined into a single “Unique Key” field.

Choose the same Name for the Duplicate Rule as for the Matching Rule. Unless of course the Duplicate Rules combines multiple Matching Rules.

Always (almost) choose “Bypass sharing rules” instead of “Enforce sharing rules”. This is not selected by default! Otherwise duplicates can still be created due to hidden records.
